# Lexical-Analyzer
To generate the lexical analyzer, I used the Flex tool (Fast Lexical Analyzer Generator), carried out the entire installation of the tool and moved on to implementing the analyzer. Below it will be explained how the program was developed.
The program structure in Flex is quite simple, it is defined in parts as rule declaration sessions and routines and was based on the C programming language.
